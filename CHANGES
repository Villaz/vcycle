==================== Changes in Vcycle version 0.5.0 =====================
- Create occi_api.py
- Each cycle is run in a newly forked subprocess for stability
- Record APEL accounting messages when VMs finish
- Use hs06 weighting when calculating target shares
- Proper man pages
- OpenStack API can now upload ISO format images (ending in .iso)
- Better guessing of IP addresses of VMs
- https_port option allows setting of MJF HTTPS server port
- Explicitly set the architecture property in uploaded images to x86_64
==================== Changes in Vcycle version 0.4.0 =====================
- VCYCLE.py becomes /usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/vcycle
- Put docs in /usr/share/doc/vcycle-VERSION
- Put vcycled, vcycle, vcycle-cgi in /usr/sbin
- Add user_data_proxy_cert/user_data_proxy_key/legacy_proxy options in
  vmtypes to put a proxy in user_data rather than a hostcert/hostkey
- creationsPerCycle calculated as 10% of max_machines in the space
- Recast using BaseSpace, OpenstackSpace, and Vmtype objects
- Use OpenStack REST API directly and drop nova dependency
- Vcycle manages key pairs and boot images automatically
- OpenstackSpace subclass moved to openstack_api.py API plugin module

- Separate [space ...] and [vmtype ...] sections in vcycle.conf
- Handle multiple vmtypes per space
- Per-space user_data directories, containing per-vmtype user_data files

  disclosure if browsing around. Obviously this is trivial to get around
  if one wants to.
- Allow connections to unauthenticated HTTPS servers for now
- Proper cleanup of old machine directories
- Target shares for vmtypes within spaces
- createdThisCycle becomes creationsThisCycle to track attempts not just
  successes in case all creations always fail
- Remove JSON files from httpd
- Add log_machineoutputs and machineoutputs_days options to vmtypes, 
  copied from Vac
